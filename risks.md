User doesn’t have enough keys  to play the game|	self explanatory|	80,00 %	|8|	6,4|	customize key bindings, extend possible key bindings beyond one input peripheral|	Philipp
Technical difficulties|	we have major problems implementing  different use cases|	45,00 %	|8|	3,6	|more research|	Dominik|
Architecture extensibility|	missing expertise with component based  Architecture might lead to obscure structure	|60,00 %|	6	|3,6|	refactoring	|Leon
Getting sidetracks by less important issues|	too much work goes in hard to implement but uncritical game mechanics/details|	95,00 %	|3	|2,85	|regularily check time estimation and act accordingly	|Leon
Loveless graphics|	due to limited time, graphics could suffer|	85,00 %	|3|	2,55|	use free assets	|Philipp
Too much work in a sprint	|too many issues lead to unrealistic  amount of work|	80,00 %	|3|	2,4	| add realistic amount of work to a sprint	|Dominik
Game mechanics don’t work out|	some thought out game mechanics  might not work out	|90,00 %|	2|	1,8	|spend more time planning come up with viable alternatives|	Lukas
Hard deployment|	due to missing expertise with Unity, deployment might be difficult 	|25,00 %|	7	|1,75|	more research|	Dominik
The game is not fun	|nobody wants to play the game because it’s no fun|	20,00 %	|8	|1,6|	add unicorns, be sad|	Leon
balancing|	without proper balancing, risk 9(no fun)  Might occur	|40,00 %|	4|	1,6	|play testing	|Lukas
Unable to meet sprint deadline|	there is not enough time to finish sprint tasks	|30,00 %|	4	|1,2|	 good scheduling, reduce sprint scope/set realistic scope	|Philipp
Unexpected breakdowns|	due to illness, hardware or infrastructural Failures	|10,00 %|	10|	1	|N/A|	Lukas
